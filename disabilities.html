                <h1>How can we overcome issues people with disabilities may face when using webpages?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="box box3">
                <p>people with disabilities can have a hard time navigating web pages, developers should take into consideration all the ways that they can improve their accessibility to people that are ‘partially sighted, neuro-diversity (such as dyslexia or the autistic spectrum), hearing loss, the elderly who suffer impairments, those with mobility or cognitive impairment (such as epilepsy), manual dexterity problems and those with learning disabilities’. This would also improve the experience of people with out disabilities as its creating a more user friendly experience, here are some ways that you can make a webpage more accessible:
                    <br><br>
                    
                    For People that have vision impairments we can use alt tags on images which will be read out by screen readers, creating transcripts for videos, putting periods in between abbreviated letters as screen readers won’t know to read out each letter individually, describe links and where they go instead of saying click here, have clear reasonable sized fonts and the websites colour palette should be easy to see.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For people with mobility problems you don’t want to use tiny buttons
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For people with learning disabilities you want to break up large amounts of text into small readable paragraphs that use simple language, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You could also include a guide on how your site is accessible and a way for feedback to be given
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Here are some statistics by the Click-Away Pound Survey 2016:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Around 6.1 million disabled internet users in the UK have access needs – and 71 percent of disabled customers with access needs will click away from a website they find difficult to use. <br><br>
                    Only 7 percent would phone a helpline and 11 percent would get help from someone else. <br><br>
                    But what’s important for brands to note is the estimated spending power of £11.75 billion in the UK alone that they miss out on when this happens – around 10 percent of the total UK online spend last year. <br><br>
                    Eighty-two percent of customers with access needs would spend more if websites were more accessible, the survey says.</p>
