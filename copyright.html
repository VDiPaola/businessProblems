                <p>Copyright affects websites as you can be sued for using other peoples work without their permission, under the fair use act you may use copyrighted work along as its transformative or for a parody. If someone posts something that’s copyrighted on your site you won’t be held responsible as long as you remove it. On the other hand if you see your content being used by someone else you can send a cease and desist letter or a DMCA dispute. Copyright laws slightly differ per region so you should look up your countries laws when unsure what falls under copyright protection. </p>
