                <p>Multiple sources have reported a range of 70-90 percent fail rate on digital projects. Lego, Burberry, Procter & Gamble, and Nike have all launched (and failed) digital projects, according to the Harvard Business Review. This could be for many reasons such as not being able to keep up with technological advances, being too ambitious without breaking down the project into manageable pieces, A lot of the contracts made are pre-agreed which doesn’t give flexibility for things to change over the course of the project. Here are some statistics on failed projects: <br>
                    <br>
                    Couchbase found that 90% of projects failed to deliver as promised, failed to deliver beyond minor improvements, or completely flopped.<br>
                    60.5% of all respondents said they are dissatisfied with their business’ ability to deliver digital projects on time and within budget. <br>
                    CIO.com reported that 50% of companies aren’t successfully executing their digital strategies, and 20% believe that those very projects are a waste of time.
