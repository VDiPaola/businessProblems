                <p>When testing a digital solution you want to make sure itâ€™s efficient and thorough to ensure a successful launch. You will need to ensure that all intended devices will have full accessibility to your product, You will need to stress test to make sure it can handle more requests than you will be expecting at launch, make sure every browser can display your site, make sure every button/function of the product works as intended, log any error messages or bugs you come across, test how much of a strain it puts on devices hardware to ensure it can run effectively as well as how much battery use over time it uses and test devices have access using different networks. You can outsource all kinds of testing to expert third parties that have a lot of experience with testing digital solutions fast and effectively if the company can affort to do so.</p>
