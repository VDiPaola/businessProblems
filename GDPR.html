        </div>
        <div class="box box3">
                <p>The GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation is an EU law on data protection and also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data by requiring data controllers (an organisation that collects data) and processors (organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller) that handle data from EU residents to follow strict guidelines, if they fail to meet these guidelines they are fined £10mil or 2% of annual global turnover (whichever is more) for a minor breach or £20mil or 4% of annual global turnover for a full breach of the regulation. If a digital project wants to collect any information on people accessing from the EU they are required to tell the user the information they are gathering and what it’s being used for aswell as needing consent from the user and once its purpose is achieved the data must be deleted.</p>
