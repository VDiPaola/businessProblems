                <p>IT has an integral part of modern business as it creates a more efficient, cost effective, scaleable and secure environment. Employees can communicate with clients quickly and clearly, company websites gives a lot of reach and informs potential clients on what you want them to know, you can gain a better public image the more you transparently interact on social media, warehouse inventory systems can easily track and manage the stock and display all the stats in readable informative ways, meetings can be held over the internet without wasting time on travel plus costs for getting everyone together, ability for employees at different locations to communicate so that distrust and tensions are less likely to happen, Having an encrypted hard drive is much more secure than a file in a cabinet so IT offers a range of security features for protecting business data.
